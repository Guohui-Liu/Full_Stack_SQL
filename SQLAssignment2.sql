--1, What is a result set? 
--An SQL result set is a set of rows from a database, as well as metadata about the query such as the column names, 
--and the types and sizes of each column. Depending on the database system, the number of rows in the result set may or may not be known.

--2, What is the difference between Union and Union All?  
--union can not be used with recursive CTE but union all can be used with recursive CTEunion will give the unique records 
--but union all gives duplicate tounion will sort the resultset based on the first column of the first select statement 
--but union all will notunion is slower than union all

--3, What are the other Set Operators SQL Server has? 
--UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, EXCEPT

--4, What is the difference between Union and Join? 
--JOIN combines data from many tables based on a matched condition between them. where as SQL combines the result-set of two or more 
--SELECT statements.
--Number of columns selected from each table may not be same. where as Number of columns selected from each table should be same.
--Datatypes of corresponding columns selected from each table can be different.where as Datatypes of corresponding columns selected 
--from each table should be same.

--5, What is the difference between INNER JOIN and FULL JOIN? 
--Inner join returns only the matching rows between both the tables, non matching rows are eliminated where as Full Join or Full Outer 
--Join returns all rows from both the tables (left & right tables), including non-matching rows from both the tables.

--6, What is difference between left join and outer join 
--Left join is a kind of outer join. Left outer join will return all rows from left query, even if there are unmatched data. 
--There are another two kinds of outer joins, which are right join and full join.  

--7, What is cross join? 
--The CROSS JOIN is used to generate a paired combination of each row of the first table with each row of the second table. 
--This join type is also known as cartesian join.

--8, What is the difference between WHERE clause and HAVING clause? 
--The WHERE clause is used in the selection of rows according to given conditions whereas the HAVING clause is used in column operations 
--and is applied to aggregated rows or groups. If GROUP BY is used then it is executed after the WHERE clause is executed in the query
What is the difference between WHERE clause and HAVING clause? 
/*
1) WHERE clause is processed right after FROM clause in the logical order of query processing, 
which means it is processed before GROUP BY clause while HAVING clause is executed after groups are created.

2) If used in GROUP BY, You can refer any column from a table in WHERE clause but you can only use columns 
which are not grouped or aggregated.
 If you use HAVING clause without group by, it can also refer any column but the index will not be used 
as opposed to WHERE clause. For example, the following have the same result set, however "where" will use the id index 
and having will do a table scan

select * from table where id = 1
select * from table having id = 1

3) You can use an aggregate function to filter rows with HAVING clause. Because HAVING clause is processed after the rows 
have been grouped, you can refer to an aggregate function in the logical expression. 
For example, the following query will display only courses which have more than 10 students :

SELECT Course, COUNT(Course) as NumOfStudent from Training GROUP BY Course HAVING COUNT(COURSE)> 10

4) Another key difference between WHERE and HAVING clause is that WHERE will use Index and HAVING will not, 
for example following two queries will produce an identical result but WHERE will use Index and HAVING will do a table scan
SELECT * FROM Course WHERE Id = 101;
SELECT * FROM Course HAVING Id = 102;

5) Since WHERE clause is evaluated before groups are formed, it evaluates for per row. 
On the other hand, the HAVING clause is evaluated after groups are formed hence it evaluates for per group.

--9,Can there be multiple group by columns? 
--Yes, a group by clause can contain two or more columns and these columns will group in order
